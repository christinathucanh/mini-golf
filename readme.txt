Instructions:
	To play this game start inside the golf ball in the lower left corner and drag your mouse to any direction 	and the ball will respond accordingly. I was not able to implement collissions so for now it only bouncess 	off the screen not the walls in the course. The ball is also only able to be interacted with one time per 	playthough since I have yet to figure out how reset the velocity.
